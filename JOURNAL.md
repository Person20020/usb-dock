# July 26th: Designed basic schematic for USB hub.

Today I made the basic schematic design for the USB C hub. At first I was going to make it with 3 USB C ports and a single USB A but I decided I don't need USB A so much so I designed it with just USB C.

**Total time spent: 2h**


# July 27th: Added DAC

I decided that I want to add a headphone audio output on this because just a USB hub seems too simple. I did some research and decided I'm going to use the PCM 2902. Datasheets are so confusing.

I started to wire things up but i'm rather confused on how the input and output are supposed to be connected. So far I have basically been copying the example in the datasheet.

**Total time spent: 3h**


# July 30th: Finished Schematic

I finished the schematic with the DAC.
